Short answer, Java is a programming language. To be precise, it's an object oriented language. It has also some functional programming in it.

<li>
Objected oriented means four things:

<ol>
<li>
Abstraction

<li>
Encapsulation

<li>
Inheritance

<li>
Polymorphism

</ol>
<li>
it does not support multiple inheritance, meaning one class can only extend one other class

<li>
Java is a statically typed language:

<ul>
<li>
any type of variable you create is known at compiler time. Even if you define a type of <code>var</code>, the compiler will guess the type of this variable.

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="What is the Object class in Java"><h3 id="What is the Object class in Java" class="header"><a href="#What is the Object class in Java">What is the Object class in Java</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
the super class of every class you can create.

<li>
when you create a class, you can explicitly extend another class with the <code>extend</code> keyword.

<ul>
<li>
even the Object class

<li>
by default the compiler makes you extend the super class.

<li>
that means every class in Java extends the Object class.

</ul>
</ul>
