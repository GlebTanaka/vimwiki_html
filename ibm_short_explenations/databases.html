<ul>
<li>
Both are database management systems that let you extract data and create reports.

<li>
But they're also fundamentally different.

<li>
MySQL is a legacy table based database that has a structured System to it.

<li>
Structured query language (SQL) on wich the mainstay of design modeling has benn based for relational database management systems.

<li>
MySQL is table based and therefore it enforces a schema.

<li>
And the schema is used so that all rows in the table will have the same columns and those columns will have specific data types.

<li>
We can thing of MySQL as being a bit more rigid with its architecture.

<li>
Has two main components. A type of storage engine and language used to work with the data.

<ul>
<li>
The storage engine is wehere the data is created, retrieved, sent and stored.

<li>
The language is how you access it.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
MongoDB is a document based system.

<li>
new approach to database design representing data as JSON. So it's object based.

<li>
was in some ways designed to supplant the legacy MySQL structure as an easier way to work with data.

<li>
Felxible for formating data structures

<li>
is a NoSQL database. It's founded upon documentes as the unit of data for serach.

<ul>
<li>
it epmployes JSON languag and it uses MongoDB qeury laguage.

<li>
additionally, MongoDB employs BISON documtens that are binary coded into typically smaller files.

<li>
many developer find BISON easier to manipulate, making data management faster.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Simlarities:

<ul>
<li>
both of them are database management systems that serve as the ground level information network for any type of digital site or space

<li>
Both support the same languages like Java or Python.

<li>
ther're open source therefore the code is freely available fro anyone who wants to use and to distribute.

<li>
both are a cloud native solution

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Which to use?

<ul>
<li>
MySQL is considered highly accessible and secure, making it well-suited to high traffic sites

<ul>
<li>
such as e-commerce sites and compliance heavy industries that require protocols for high security.

</ul>
<li>
MongoDB use of dynamic schema design, fosters a more flexible environment for data search, coding, integration and database development.

<ul>
<li>
it's optimal for content management systemns and high query sites such as analytics applications.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="PostgreSQL vs MySQL"><h2 id="PostgreSQL vs MySQL" class="header"><a href="#PostgreSQL vs MySQL">PostgreSQL vs MySQL</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
similarities:

<ul>
<li>
both are relational database management systems (RDBMS). They organize data into tables

<li>
both rely on structured query language (SQL), which is the standard language for interaction with management systemns.

<ul>
<li>
with SQL analysts don't need to know where a given table is or how there are connected.

<li>
the database comiles the query and figures out all of the correct data points.

</ul>
<li>
both support JSON, a JavaScript object notaion to store and stransport data.

<li>
but PostgreSQL and MySQL offer fundamentally different value propositions.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
PostgreSQL is one of the most compliant, stable and mature relational databases available today.

<ul>
<li>
it's very goog with complex queries. 

<li>
PostrgreSQL is object relational and it appeals to enterprises databases administrators responsible for managing online transaction processing (OLTP).

<li>
OLTP firmly goes under the PostgreSQL column.

<li>
it provides those protocols for business activities like:

<ul>
<li>
e-commerce • cutomer relationship management • financial ledgers

</ul>
<li>
also ideal for managing the analytics of the data received, created and generated.

<ul>
<li>
some of the benefits or PostgreSQL are related to:

<ul>
<li>
performance and scalability

<li>
including data analysis across mulitple datat types.

<li>
there is also multi version concurrency control (MUCC)

<ul>
<li>
that enables the simultaneous occrrence of write oppertaions and reads.

</ul>
<li>
there is also business conituity support

<ul>
<li>
that's provided with high availability of services through asynchronous or synchronous replication methods across servers.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
if you need to process complex queries with multiple data types support and if you're looking for a database with great concurrency control, PostrgreSQK should be a go to option.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) that's been around for a long time.

<li>
it's known for beeing easy to use and being very fast, making it a popular choice around WEB applications in particular.

<li>
MySQL is typically used for samlle scale web apps that don't need the same level of performance and complexity as enterpirse applications.

<li>
some other benefits are:

<ul>
<li>
the ease of use.

<li>
very optimized to get it up fast and running and get started.

<li>
speed - support for high speed partial indexes, full text indexes

<li>
and has an unique memory chaches that can result in superior database performance. 

<li>
there is also support for scalability.

<ul>
<li>
with support for unlimeted storage growth and a small footprint.

</ul>
<li>
if you looking for a fast, easy to use database for small medium sized web apps, MySQL is agreat option

</ul>
</ul>
