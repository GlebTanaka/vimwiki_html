<p>
Imagine you build a web application for an ice cream shop, to show the flavors fo ice cream that are in stock that day.
And allow the workers to actually make updates to those flavors.
You can do this with a REST API:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
the web app communicates with a cloud-based server via REST API.

<li>
<code>REST</code> stands for Representational State Transfer.

<ul>
<li>
it's a standardized software architecture style, a specific type of API.

<li>
<code>API</code>  (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two or more programs to communicate with each other.

<li>
it's all about communiation. Client with Server and vice versa.

<li>
RESTful web service means that a service uses REST API to communicate.

<li>
Benefits of REST API:

<ul>
<li>
simple and standardized approach to communication

<li>
scalable ans stateless:

<ul>
<li>
as the service gorws in complexity you can easily make modifications

<li>
don't need to keep track of, waht data is in wich state across client and server.

</ul>
<li>
high performance - due to the fact that they support caching.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
for the web app you will have an endpoint <code>https://icecream.com/api/flavors</code>

<ul>
<li>
api singals, that this is a communicatin endpoint

<li>
flavors are <code>recources</code> in this REST API

</ul>
<li>
the main building blocks of this API are:

<ul>
<li>
<code>request</code> that is sent from the client to the server

<ul>
<li>
header: to pass additional iformation about the request and client itself

<li>
has an operation: like GET

<li>
an endpoint: 

<li>
a body or parameters: in JSON 

</ul>
<li>
<code>response</code> - that is rcveived back from the server typicly in JSON      

<li>
Actions or verbs you want to make:

<ul>
<li>
CRUD - Creat • Read • Update • Delete

<ul>
<li>
how are REST APIs stateless?
    An appllication, API or web service that is considered stateful stores data from the client on its own server.
    For example if a username and password were passed from the client to the server as a from of authentication, and the server
    stores that data, than the web server ist statfull. This is because the server is now storing data from the client.
    REST architecture requires that the client state is not stored on the server.
    Instead each request made by the client must contain all necessary information for that particular HTTP method.

</blockquote>
    
<ul>
<li>
Explain the HTTP methods
    RESTful web services will use HTTP methods and client requests. The most common methods are:

<ul>
<li>
GET - fetches a resource from the server

<li>
POST - requests for a resource to be created on the server

<li>
PUT - requests for a resource to be updated

<li>
DELETE - requests for a resource to be deleted
    These four method correspong to CRUD opertaions

</ul>
</ul>
   
<ul>
<li>
explain the HTTP status codes
    RESTful web services use HTTP status codes in server responses. The most common types of status codes are 200 codes.
    200 codes represent a successful request and respons
    400 codes represents a clien-side error
    500 codes represents a server-side error

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
What is a URI?
    URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. It identifies every resource in the REST architecutre.

<ul>
<li>
A URI rca be one of two types

<ul>
<li>
URN Uniform Resource Locator - wich identifies a resource through a unique and persistent name like a books ISBN

<li>
URL Uniform Resource Locator- wich is your typical web address.

</ul>
<li>
URLs are typically used when designing REST APIs

</ul>
</ul>
    
<ul>
<li>
What are best practice in making the URI for RESTful web-services?
    URI should be mostly sandardizes when developing a RESTful web-service.
    This way clients can more easily work with the web service:

<ol>
<li>
forwar slashes indicate hierarchy

<li>
use plural nouns for branches

<li>
use hyphens for mulitple words

<li>
use lower case

<li>
refrain from using file extensions

</ol>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
What are the diffenreces between REST and SOAP?
    While REST is an architecture used to develop web-services, SOAP (Simple Object Acces Protocol)
    serves as a protocol for exchanging structured information by way of APIs.
    While REST has felxible stndrads, SOAP standards are much more strict in that there implementation
    and statefulness often means that the client and server are closer connected.
    Additionally while REST allows for data transder in JSON, XML and others, SOAP only supports XML.
    In general, SOAPis a stricter and more Niche alternative to REST. It's used where more
    regulated and staple data needs to be transfered.

</ul>
    
<ul>
<li>
What are the differences between REST and AJAX?
    AJAX refers to asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Its a collectin of web technologies that allow for asynchronous web applications
    using the built-in XML HTTP reqeust Object.
    While REST API refers to an architecture for handling HTTP request,
    AJAX refers to a collection of web technologies for making asynchronous web requests.
    This means that a REST API may handle AJAX clients and that AJAX may be used to send RESTful requests.
    But a REST API could never be implemented nor replaced by AJAX

</ul>
    
<ul>
<li>
What are some tools used to develop and test REST APIs?
    The tools used to develop and test REST APIs depend on the language used.
    Different tools exists depending on whether the language is JAVA, node.js, python ect.
    In the case of node.js frameworks like Express are commonly used.
    For testing there is Postman, which is used to ensure resources are being deliverd and each facet of a REST API is performing as designed.

</ul>
    
<ul>
<li>
What are some real-world examples of REST APIs?
    Nearly every facet of the web. By going to the exponent website there is a GET request sent to a server at the URL
    for the necessary HTML to display to the client. Most commonly as a developer REST APIs are used to manipluate data
    from a particular database using the four main HHTP methods:

<ul>
<li>
retrieving file data

<li>
accesing images

<li>
hosting a website 
    All requires use of REST APIs

</ul>
</ul>
    
<ul>
<li>
Pro and Cons:

<ul>
<li>
Pros:

<ul>
<li>
easy to learn

<li>
wide range of data tranferes like JSON and XML

<li>
Statelessness - allowing for a simpler client experience

<li>
scaleability - due to the independent nature of client and server

</ul>
<li>
disadvantages:

<ul>
<li>
sessin not being able to be maintaned because of statelessness

<li>
a lack of build-in security measures

<li>
need to be versioned for backwards compatibility when being updated

<li>
Consistency in URIs difficult to maintain for complex projecxts

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
What is XML? - <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp</a>

<ul>
<li>
XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.

<li>
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language

<li>
XML is a markup language much like HTML

<li>
XML was designed to store and transport data

<li>
XML was designed to be self-descriptive

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The Difference Between XML and HTML?
  XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

<ul>
<li>
XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is

<li>
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks

<li>
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

</ul>
</ul>
